# ozemobileappTest
This is a sample test for the OZE Mobile App Interview

The app actual apk is not available for external users. Hence I used a sample apk to run different test in contrary to the sighn up test.

Due to the short time and the small feature to be tested on the app, I wrote an automation test with using a single page approach rather than the page object model.

This test is open for review

Thanks
